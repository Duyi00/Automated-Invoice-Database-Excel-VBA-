# Automated-Invoice-Database
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An Excel macro that allows users to create / modify an invoice or pull an existing invoice from their database.

A template of the workbook is attached for you to try it out.
I personally use this macro to help me keep track of my tuition work.

The excel consits of **3 worksheets**.
- Invoice (shMain)
- Database (shMaster)
- Control (shCon)


## Invoice (shMain)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This contains the invoice, and will be the worksheet that users interact with to input, modify or pull out existing data from the database.

There are  **3** actions that users can perform.
- Add Data
- Edit Data
- Upload

## Database (shMaster)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the database and contains all the past data of invoices that were uploaded. Users can also pull out existing data from this database.

## Control (shCon)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This contains the tables and excel formulas that is required for the entire workbook to work.
